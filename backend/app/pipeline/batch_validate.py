"""
Validates a batch of extracted scenes for one AOI BEFORE ingestion,
so problems (AOI drift, inconsistent CRS, wrong band count, mismatched
shapes, missing months, duplicate dates) show up as one readable report
instead of as a confusing failure halfway through a long ingestion run
or -- worse -- as silently wrong tile IDs.

This directly answers the request from the previous conversation turn:
"a script you run once across all the downloaded zips that checks
band order/shape/CRS consistency and flags AOI drift or missing months."
