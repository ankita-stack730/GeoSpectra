"""
Stage 16 -- Clustering / Discovery

Groups every embedded tile into clusters of visually/semantically
similar sites using HDBSCAN (density-based, so it does not force every
tile into a cluster and does not require picking k in advance -- both
matter for open-world satellite imagery where "how many types of site
exist in this AOI" isn't known ahead of time). Falls back to KMeans if
there are too few tiles for HDBSCAN's minimum cluster size, which
happens on small demo AOIs like the synthetic one used for testing.

This directly implements 2.2.4: "an analyst who identifies one location
of interest can discover other locations with comparable visual or
semantic characteristics without manually constructing a new query."
Once cluster_id is written to SQLite, "similar sites" is just
`SELECT ... WHERE cluster_id = ?` -- no new embedding call needed.
