Stage 14 -- Change-Type Interpretation

Refinement 3.5 from the architecture review: zero-shot text-prompt
classification is a CANDIDATE interpretation, not ground truth. We
always return a confidence alongside the label, and the caller (the
review-queue UI / evaluation report) is expected to present it as
such -- never as a certainty.

Method: embed the "after" tile once, embed each candidate label as a
short natural-language prompt, and take a softmax over the tile-to-label
cosine similarities. This is exactly CLIP's own zero-shot classification
recipe, just applied to a satellite tile instead of a photo.
